# voyanta coding challenge

This project contains my solution to the coding challenge posed by Voyanta. The requirements are as follows:

General Requirements
For all stages of this exercise:
-	The used language must be Java 6-8
-	All frameworks / technologies accepted.
-	Assume this code is to be used in a production environment.

### Exercise 1 - Create an API
Create an API to do an addition and send back the response. All requests and responses must be in JSON format. All requests and responses must contain a unique identifier.

### Exercise 2 - The requirement evolves:
Now we need to do thousands of calculations in one request. Improve the API.

### Exercise 3 - Further evolution:  
Assume that the addition is actually a very heavy calculation that takes significant time. We need to cache the calculation to minimise repetitive processing of the expensive addition calculation. Use some kind of  database.
